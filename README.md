# Sensible Sogral
A more sensible bus schedule app than Sogral's official web thingy. **\[WIP\]**

This repo contains a scrapper and a web app that were developed back in July 2019 when I started learning functional programming with Ramda.

## Features
Compared to the official thingy:

- Single page app, offline-first, light

- Bookmarkable depart-destination pages (e.g. Annaba-Constantine: https://djalil.me/sensible-sogral/#depart=12&dest=18)

- Installable as PWA **(WIP)**

- [ ] Accessible **(TODO)**
